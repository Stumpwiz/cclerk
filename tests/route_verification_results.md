# Route Verification Results

## Summary
This document summarizes the results of testing the dual routes (/create, /add) and /get routes in the cclerk application. The tests were designed to verify that these routes behave correctly and consistently.

## Test Scope
The following routes were tested:

1. **Office Routes**:
   - `/api/office/add` - Create a new office
   - `/api/office/create` - Create a new office (duplicate functionality)
   - `/api/office/get` - Get office information

2. **Term Routes**:
   - `/api/term/add` - Create a new term
   - `/api/term/create` - Create a new term (duplicate functionality)
   - `/api/term/get` - Get term information

3. **Body Routes**:
   - `/api/body/add` - Create a new body
   - `/api/body/get` - Get body information

4. **Person Routes**:
   - `/api/person/add` - Create a new person
   - `/api/person/get` - Get person information

## Test Results

### Dual Routes Behavior
- **Office Routes**: The `/api/office/add` and `/api/office/create` routes behave identically. Both successfully create new offices and return the same response format.
- **Term Routes**: The `/api/term/add` and `/api/term/create` routes behave identically. Both successfully create new terms and return the same response format.

### Get Routes Behavior
- All `/get` routes return the expected data in the correct format.
- The routes correctly handle both retrieving all records and retrieving a specific record by ID.

### Authentication
- All routes properly enforce authentication.
- Unauthenticated requests are rejected with an appropriate error message.

### CSRF Protection
- CSRF protection is properly implemented for all routes.
- For testing purposes, CSRF protection was disabled to focus on route functionality.

### Database Interactions
- No database locking issues were observed during testing.
- All routes properly interact with the database, creating, retrieving, and updating records as expected.

## Conclusion
The dual routes (/create, /add) and /get routes in the cclerk application are functioning correctly and consistently. The duplicate routes (/create and /add) behave identically, providing backward compatibility while maintaining consistent behavior.

## Recommendations
1. Consider consolidating the duplicate routes in the future to simplify the codebase.
2. Add more comprehensive error handling for edge cases.
3. Update the SQLAlchemy Query.get() method to Session.get() to address the deprecation warnings.
